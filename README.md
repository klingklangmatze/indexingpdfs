# indexingpdfs

This small Python script can be used to index crystallographic orientations of planar deformation lamellae in shocked quartz grains. I use this to quickly check if the U-stage measurements I made on the polarization microscope make sense. 


The crystallographic calculations are based on: 
Langenhorst, F. (2002). Shock metamorphism of some minerals: Basic introduction and microstructural observations. Bulletin of the Czech Geological Survey, 77(4), 265-282.

Stereographic projection template is based on:

Ferriere, L., Morrow, J. R., Amgaa, T., & Koeberl, C. (2009). Systematic study of universal‚Äêstage measurements of planar deformation features in shocked quartz: Implications for statistical significance and representation of results. Meteoritics & Planetary Science, 44(6), 925-940.
